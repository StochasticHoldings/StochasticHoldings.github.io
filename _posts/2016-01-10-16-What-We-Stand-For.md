## We Embrace Randomness...Take Aim... Invent Tools
Stochastic comes from the greek word stokhos,meaning "aim" [See Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic). In modern lexicon it is used to describe randomness. When one aims at a target, there are many possible outcomes for each attempted shot.  **Stochastic Holdings, Inc.** embraces the concept of randomness as a part of life (much like change).  We believe that it is not as important to hit your target in the bullseye everytime, but it is important to take aim, and to hone your abilities using the best tools available.  If the tools do not exist, they must be invented.

### A Philosophy

Colby Uva, Stochastic Holding, Inc's president received a present from his late grandfather on the day of his high school graduation.  The present was a poem, a poem that can be seen as a metaphor for the Stochastic Philosophy.

**"*...One ship sails East,
And another West,
By the self-same winds that blow,
'Tis the set of the sails
And not the gales,
That tells the way we go...*"**
